# Multi-UAV-TA

Multi-UAV-TA is an open-source repository that implements a custom environment for training and evaluating different algorithms, including reinforcement learning (RL), in a multi-UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) target assignment scenarios using OpenAI Gym. The environment is designed to simulate multiple UAVs working together to assign and track targets in real-time, making it a valuable resource for researchers and engineers working on UAV coordination, multi-agent systems, and aerial surveillance applications.

(this is just the initial version and it is not working in its full capabilities)
